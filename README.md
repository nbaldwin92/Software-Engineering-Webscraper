# E-Commerce Product Analyzer

This web application allows the user to enter a URL of an Amazon or Ebay product and receive a score on a scale of 0-100. The score represents the likelihood that the product listing is a scam. The user will be displayed a chart and a percentage score. If the listing is likely a scam, the user will be warned. Otherwise, they will be notified that the listing is likely safe and the seller is trusted. The main purpose is to eliminate the amount of scams that happen on Amazon and Ebay.
